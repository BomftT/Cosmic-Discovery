        <div className="content">
          Group 5 was established on November 4, 2024 with the goal of
          researching the universe.In addition to theoretical and practical
          research through research projects, our team is also particularly
          interested in space observatories around the globe. We not only learn
          about famous observatories like the (formerly) Arecibo Observatory in
          Puerto Rico, or the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, but also study the
          equipment and technology these observatories use. used to track and
          study planets and constellations in the solar system and distant
          regions of space.Our team also conducts research on extrasolar
          planets, constellations such as Orion, Andromeda, and giant stars in
          distant constellations. We look forward to connecting and
          collaborating with observatories around the world, to expand our
          understanding of the universe and contribute to progress in
          astronomical research.We hope that, through these studies, we will
          contribute to building a strong astronomy community, sharing knowledge
          about astronomical phenomena and discoveries from global space
          observatories.
